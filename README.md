# MAX7219
Library for driving MAX7219 displays using STM32

## SPI configuration
In order o use the library your SPI peripheral has to be configured in the following way.

And you also need to provide a GPIO pin that will be used as a chip select line.

## Example
There is an example project that was generated by STM32CubeMX in the `example` directory.
You can find the example code in `example/Src/example.cpp` where I show some basic usage of the library.

## Building the example
```shell
cmake .
make
```
