# MAX7219
Library for driving MAX7219 displays using STM32

## SPI configuration
In order to use the library your SPI peripheral has to be configured in the following way.
You can change the prescaler to adjust the baudrate to be within the MAX7219's operating range.

And you also need to provide a GPIO pin that will be used as a chip select line.

## Example
There is an example project that was generated by STM32CubeMX in the `example` directory.
You can find the example code in [`example/Src/example.cpp`](https://github.com/petoknm/MAX7219/blob/master/example/Src/example.cpp) where I show some basic usage of the library.
